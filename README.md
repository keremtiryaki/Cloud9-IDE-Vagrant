Cloud9 IDE with Vagrant
===============

I created this repo for my personal usage. 
Feel free to fork it, use it, open issues or requests

- Cloud9 IDE 
- Vagrant
- ansible roles for provisioning
- simple mac client app (The app is actually a simplest webbrowser) 
	- it only opens the vagrant box c9 ide 
	- http://10.0.0.222:8181/
	- yeah! I have a fullscreen mode
	
> **Note:**
> - this repo contains my own user.settings for c9.IDE `/roles/cloud9/templates/c9.user.settings.j2`

Quick start
---
install vagrant and run
`vagrant up `
once it is up you can open the 
`C9-Mac-App-build/C9-Mac-App.app` to use ide.
